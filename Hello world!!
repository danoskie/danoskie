- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @danoskie
A young Nigerian blogger who loves to learn something new every now and then.
That's by the way.
I love doing things by the help of a working system.
Yeah, that means automating some certain actions.
No time to waste.
That's the major reason that am here.
I wish to work on my writing and coding skills, invest in a project and also collaborate with good fellows to see a project see the light of the day.
That's me.
I'll add more to this with time.
Thanks for stopping by.
